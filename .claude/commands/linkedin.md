I want to write a LinkedIn post together using defined subagents.

Can you start off by asking me the topic of the LinkedIn post.

Then once the goal of the post is clear can you sequentially:

- use the linkedin-researcher subagent to research the topic
- use the linkedin-writer subagent to write the post
- finally use the linkedin-image subagent to recommend an image

Your final response should include:
- the post itself
- a list of the links found in the research phase
- a 1 sentence description of the recommended image
